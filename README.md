### smips

For a subset of MIPS instructions in C language. Using a reference implementation, I converted 32-bit instructions into their corresponding MIPS instruction, followed by the output produced after executing said instructions, followed by register values. Gained experience with bit operations and low level programming giving me a better understanding of CPU implementation.
